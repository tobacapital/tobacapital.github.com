	<p>It is a time of seismic change for the enterprise. We back entrepreneurs who map the fissures and are quick to build on shaking ground.</p>

<div class="maintext">
	<p>Toba Capital is a venture firm founded by Vinny Smith. We are a team with twice the per capita operating experience of traditional VCs, investing in the markets we know firsthand: business applications and IT &amp; internet infrastructure.</p>

	<p>Our background enables us to provide portfolio companies with unique operational support. We know what it takes to build a billion dollar software company and have seen both sides of over a hundred investments and M&amp;A transactions.</p>

	<p>Our diligence process is a collaborative exploration of three major variables: your team, traction, and our opportunity to add value. We will never have a &lsquo;standard&rsquo; investment profile; for businesses with transformative potential we believe that one size fits less than none.</p>
